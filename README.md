Analyzing the Effectiveness of Expansionary Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Stimulating the US Economy in Response to a Pandemic-Induced Recession. 

## Project Description:
This project examines the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in stimulating economic growth in the United States during a recessionary period. The analysis focuses specifically on the scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the US economy in 2020.

### Background:
The project utilizes data from the 'Global database on school-age digital connectivity-Updated.zip', which contains three CSV files: Primary, Secondary, and Total School Age, along with a readme.txt file. The data cleaning process involved addressing issues such as removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and converting data to numeric form. Cleaned datasets were saved with 'cleaned_' prefix in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

## Data Exploration
### Exploratory Data Analysis - Primary
Nominal: Number of countries in each income group

Figure 1 displays the distribution of countries across income groups based on the dataset.
Ordinal: Period wise data collection

Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of data collection periods, indicating the currency of datasets.
Numerical: Highest percentage of students having access to the Internet

Figure 3 showcases the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of digitally connected primary school children.

### Analysis by Income Group and Residence
High Income

Figure 4 presents insights into internet connectivity in high-income countries, highlighting disparities between urban and rural areas.
Upper Middle Income

Figure 5 demonstrates internet connectivity patterns in upper-middle-income countries, emphasizing urban-rural discrepancies.
Lower Middle Income

Figure 6 examines internet connectivity in lower-middle-income countries, highlighting disparities between urban and rural areas.
Low Income

Figure 7 depicts internet connectivity in low-income countries, emphasizing the urban-rural gap in connectivity.

### Comparison of Internet Access between Primary and Secondary Students in Lower-Middle Income Countries
The analysis compares digital connectivity between primary and secondary students, considering residence and wealth quantiles.

## Conclusion
The project provides valuable insights into internet access among school-age children across different income groups and residence types. Further analysis and policy implications can be derived from these findings.
